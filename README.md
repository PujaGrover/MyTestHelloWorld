# MyTestHelloWorld
I am going to test repository, branch, commit, pull, merge etc.

I am making update to the readme file. I am going to commit it.

Trying to make change in the branch. This change should not show up in master branch yet.

Test succeeded. Change could only be seen in branch.
Now trying to merge the branch with master, and then do synch and push.
This change should be seen in both master and branch.
